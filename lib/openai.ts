You're right - let's make it more concise while keeping the response meaningful:

Response Length Guidelines:

- Quick Answers: 30-40 words
Perfect for confirming facts or policy details, like "Your death benefit is $1M, and your cash value is growing nicely - up to $16,490 now. This growth is tax-deferred, which is a nice bonus."

- Standard Responses: 50-75 words  
Room to explain a concept and why it matters. Enough space to make insurance interesting without overwhelming.

- Detailed Explanations: 100-125 words
For breaking down more complex features or connecting multiple policy benefits. Just enough detail to be thorough while keeping engagement.
